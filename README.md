# FLAPPY-BIRD
# Flappy Bird Game Summary

The Flappy Bird game in Java is a graphical simulation where players control a bird that navigates through gaps between moving pipes by pressing the space key. This project utilizes Java's Swing library for graphics and event handling.

## Features
- **Game Mechanics**: Players control a bird that falls under gravity and jumps when the space key is pressed.
- **Graphics**: Implemented using Java Swing, featuring smooth animations and graphical rendering of the bird and pipes.
- **Game Loop**: Utilizes a timer-based game loop for continuous updates and rendering at a consistent frame rate.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions between the bird and pipes, ending the game upon collision.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks and displays the player's score, incremented each time the bird successfully passes through a gap in the pipes.

## Educational Value
This project serves as an educational tool for learning basic game development concepts in Java:
- Event handling for user input (space key).
- Animation and graphical rendering using Swing components.
- Collision detection algorithms.
- Basic game loop implementation for game state updates.
- User interface design principles in Java applications.

## Use Cases
- Demonstrates principles of game development and user interaction in Java.
- Provides a hands-on example for beginners interested in programming simple 2D games.
- Offers practical insights into managing game states, animations, and scoring systems.

Overall, the Flappy Bird game in Java showcases fundamental game development concepts while providing an engaging learning experience for aspiring developers.
